# MIRT: The Michigan Image Reconstruction Toolbox

MIRT.jl is a collection of Julia functions for performing image reconstruction
and solving related inverse problems.

It is very much still under construction,
although there are already enough tools
to solve useful problems
like compressed sensing MRI reconstruction.
Trying the
[demos](https://github.com/JeffFessler/mirt-demo)
is a good way to get started.

The documentation is even more still under construction.

Further examples will likely be shared at
[JuliaImageRecon](https://github.com/JuliaImageRecon);
see
[Examples](https://github.com/JuliaImageRecon/Examples)
there.
