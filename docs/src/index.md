# MIRT: The Michigan Image Reconstruction Toolbox

[MIRT.jl](https://github.com/JeffFessler/MIRT.jl)
is a collection of Julia functions
for performing image reconstruction
and solving related inverse problems.

It is very much still under construction,
although there are already enough tools
to solve useful problems
like compressed sensing MRI reconstruction.
Trying the
[demos](https://github.com/JeffFessler/mirt-demo)
is a good way to get started.

The documentation is even more still under construction.

More complete examples are at
[JuliaImageRecon](https://github.com/JuliaImageRecon);
see
[Examples](https://github.com/JuliaImageRecon/Examples)
there.
