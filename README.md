# MIRT (Michigan Image Reconstruction Toolbox) in Julia

This is a collection of tools for image reconstruction
in the open-source
[Julia language](https://julialang.org/).

Currently it contains a limited
collection of the tools from the
[Matlab version of MIRT](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/code),
but this collection will grow over time.

This software was developed at the University of Michigan
by
[Jeff Fessler](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler)
and his
[group](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/group).
