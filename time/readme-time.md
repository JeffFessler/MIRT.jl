This directory has timing tests for some of the functions in MIRT.
These tests helped me choose between different methods in some cases.
These tests are isolated here so that they are ignored for code coverage
and so that the package tests are not delayed by any timing runs.
The related code in `../benchmark/` has more sophisticated benchmarking tests
so the code here is mainly just for archival purposes
and unlikely to be of interest to most users.
